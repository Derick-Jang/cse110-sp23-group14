## Development Process:
We used Chat GPT to generate some ideas on how to make a magic 8-ball in a web app, and also some features it could have. We also used AI to help generate code and write unit tests.


## Testing
- Researched testing libraries such as Puppeteer
	- Needed to use a library like Puppeteer to test the custom user input questions
	- Could not implement Puppeteer since it relied on the DOM which we didn't understand
- Experimented with writing tests using ChatGPT
	- Tests ChatGPT were not the best tests
		- Didn't fit specifications for project
		- Tests had bugs
		- Overall not good
- Tested by hand
	- Tested no question inputted
	- Tested no custom answers
	- Tested back button
	- Tested on different browsers
	- Obviously testing by hand is not ideal, but for a simple project like the 8-ball we could run through almost all edge cases by hand (in future will definitely have rigorous testing)
