## How to run tests

Run the commands below: 

`npm run serve-port` & `npm test`

Be sure to kill the port before running again.

You can see if serve still running with `ps aux | grep "npm run serve-port"`

If there are >1 items, then the port is still open and you have to kill the PID of the first one.

SERVER_PORT = 36873
