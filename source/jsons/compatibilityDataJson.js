            "description": "As they say, how can you love somebody else unless you love yourself? If you date someone of the same sign, congratulations. You've probably embraced your quirks and accepted your humanity. Now, you can celebrate that with a kindred spirit! If you haven't learned to love yourself, warts and all, this relationship can inspire some crucial self-acceptance. Remember, though: #twinning might be comfortable, but autonomy is important to keep that frisky friction. Maintain some separation between your lives, even if it's easy to hang out together. Otherwise, passion may cool to a brother-sister vibe."

Of course, all that friction can lead to explosive sexual chemistry, even an obsessive quest to figure each other out (you never will). Some astrologers believe that each sign is an evolved version of the one before it. The sign after yours is a teacher. However, like a rebellious teen seeking emancipation from a parent, you may never admit that this person has taught you anything. This cosmic combination can make for painful breakups and a seething sexual tension that lingers for a lifetime."

Your signs are always of a compatible 'element' (for example, they're a water sign and you're an earth sign, which are both of the 'feminine' quality), making this a great match. You'll often have similar values and attitudes about politics, raising a family, which movies to rent. Friendship and communication are the hallmarks of this aspect.\n\nBeing best friends is easy. Keeping the sexy spark alive? A little challenging. You'll need to structure 'date nights' or set up scenarios that get you out of buddy mode."

It's the relationship that helps you work through issues with a difficult parent, usually by reactivating old, painful wounds. There can be power struggles and clashing agendas. Don't expect to kick back and put your feet up in this match.\n\nThe dynamic tension will keep you active and keyed up. Of course, that could be exactly what you want. The opportunity of the 'square' aspect is to teach you how to compromise with an equally strong-willed partner. When you strike that delicate balance, you can make an undeniable 'power couple'—a true force to be reckoned with."

You'll need to adapt to your differences, which could take a great deal of adjustment, even discarding a former lifestyle. For one of you, the relationship will be about sex and intimacy; for the other, duty and service.
