## <ins>**Introduction**</inns>

### *What is fortune-telling?*
Fortune-telling is the act of trying to gain information about the future. This information could be anything ranging from the weather or to more complex topics like love. Fortune-telling is widespread, found in many cultures across the world in a wide variety of forms. Now, whether or not any of the information gained through these methods is accurate or useful is *highly* questionable. However, whether those who engage with it actually believe it works or merely see it as an entertaining activity, fortune-telling will continue to live on in an age lacking in superstition.

## <ins>**Our Purpose**</ins>
* Provide users with a fun and convenient way to explore their future
* Tools for decision making (help break past decision paralysis)
* Gain inspiration
* Deeper understanding of themselves
* Social interaction, friends
