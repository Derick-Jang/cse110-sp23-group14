# Progressive Web app decision: We will try to do it, but first do a test on our 8-ball. 

## Context and Problem Statement

What are progressive webapps? 
How hard is it to make a regular website a progressive webapp? 
Should we implement this into our project? 

## What is a progressive web app

* Allows us to run a website on a phone
* Can give us access to camera + gps and other phone things
* Allows us to create an app using only website
* Designed to be capable, reliable, and installable

## How can we make a progressive web app

* Built and enhanced with modern API
* Workbox
* PWACompact
* Requires us to do some rewriting of website code
* Most code the same in terms of HTML and JS
* Example web app from MDN: [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Tutorials/js13kGames/Introduction)
* Allows us to us push notifications

## Decision Outcome

Inconclusive decision. We need to do more research on how easy it is to turn a project into a PWA by turning out 8-ball into a PWA. Then we can consider doing the same for our fortune-telling app.
