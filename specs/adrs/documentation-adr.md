# Decision Outcome: Chose Markdown for Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a good way to document our code. Should we use automatic documentation generation? 
What does user documentation require, and how would it look?

## Considered Options

* Markdown
* Generating docs 
* User facing docs
	- FAQs
	- About Us
* Google drive
* Project Planning tools like Atlassian Jira
* ADR wiki such as MediaWiki

## Decision Outcome

We are planning on using Markdown for our documentation, as generating docs looks difficult. 
Pros and cons of Markdown: 
- simple to use
- we all kind of know how to use it
- can put everything on git
- however, is basic compared to other options
- fewer features than other project planning tools

For user docs, we will have FAQs, about us, and troubleshoots.
