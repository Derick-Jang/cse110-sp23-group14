# Architectural Design Review: Horoscope Delivery

## Context and Problem Statement

- Need to decide how to display horoscope

## Considered Options

- Pop-up: Previous design on figma
- Go to new page: New idea

## Decision Outcome (05/28)

- Stick with pop up
- Add animation to pop up
- Due to Tuesday deadline

## Discussion

- Current design fade background and put pop up
- Current design hard to add ceremony
- Animate letter being opened up?
- Constellations forming
- Pop up is currently a div
- Weird to have pop up over the menu
	- Better to have daily report on new page
- Extra step for opening the menu bar if we go to new page
- Put see daily horoscope on main page
- menu only for easy access
- Idea: Very long page + menu to jump to sections
- Can you make animation with pop up:
