What Didn't Go Well?
--------------------
Add notes about things that did not go well in the last iteration.

- Conflicts (7 votes)
    - Since we are all working on the same branch now, conflict is really common.
    - i think also multiple people working on the same issue (making HTML/css for homepage) made it little confusing 
    - Some communication was difficult and people were working on the same thing separately
    - People working on too wide a variety of things

- Distribution (12 votes)
    - A couple people did a lot of the work especially for ci/cd (I have no idea what is happening there and I would like to know)
    - Messy delegation of work
    - distribution of work was a bit wonky at times, I felt like I had to really find things for me to do because I wanted to avoid working on something as the same time as someone else
    - Something that didn't go well was the distribution of tasks as some people were given too much work and some people were given too little
- A lot more solo programming than true "pair" programming, but that would require time to be allocated for both parties (1 vote)
- the homepage display, functionality of features (0 votes)
- We did a lot of the work at the end (back-end-load heavy) (0 votes)
