Hi everyone! We’re Team 14, the Net Ninjas. We consist of: our amazing leaders Varun and Nick, our designer is Tim, and the rest of us are developers: Melody, Christina, Wincy, Jisol, Mary, Jim, and Luke. Our values are good software engineering, being sneaky, and teamwork. We’ve certainly endeavored to embody these values in our product, Zodiak.

As you can see, this is our homepage with our logo. There are shooting stars that are falling in the background, which is part of our astrology theme. On the left hand side, we have the navigation bar, which can lead you to the different sections of our app. We have our homepage, Daily Report page which will show you the daily horoscope, Compatibility page which will tell you the compatibility of two zodiac signs, Life Path Number which can tell you about your personality, characteristics, career, and love, and finally the settings page and FAQ page. 

On our settings page, there is no name and birthday on record for new users. After you update your name and birthday, Zodiak will generate a daily horoscope for you. The “Today’s horoscope” button generates a pop-up that displays your zodiac sign, today’s date, and an animation of your horoscope. You can click the share button to copy to your device’s clipboard a shareable message of text and emojis containing your horoscope that you can send to your friends. 

Now onto the compatibility section. Here we have a table of the twelve zodiac signs with the corresponding birthdays for easy reference. You can click two signs in any combination, and then the check compatibility button, and a popup will appear with the two signs’ compatibility. 

Now for the lifepath number. The first two features are personality and characteristics, and it details some insight about you as a person. These messages are slightly longer, so you can scroll within the popup to read the whole text. There is also about the career and love aspects of your life.

Back to the settings page, you can update your profile even after you’ve set your name and birthday. You might want to do this if you are changing users – first you use the site and then your friend, for example. You can also clear your data for privacy, which is saved locally. 

Lastly, we have our FAQ page. There is some information here about horoscopes and zodiacs in general, as well as instructions on how to use our compatibility feature and where to reach the developers. 

Something very cool about our product is that it works on mobile, too!! We’re super proud of this feature because it wasn’t easy adapting the site to be mobile-friendly! We had to learn how to make it a progressive web app, which was challenging, but fortunately it worked, so it’s rewarding.

As a large group, one of the challenges we faced was working on top of each other. There were a lot of merge conflicts and once or twice, two of us accidentally worked on the same feature independently! We overcame this after our first sprint review, though, by being clearer in assigning tasks and communicating more effectively in general. 

Now that we are done, something we would do differently is start coding sooner. We really took the process to heart, and we maybe erred a little too much on the side of caution and spent a long time on our planning phases. Given the fact that this is only a 10 week quarter, however, there’s not actually a whole lot of time to produce code, so we would have benefitted from starting sooner, because we would have been able to add more cool features in.

Overall, we had a great time developing our product together this quarter. We are fortunate to start off teammates and end as friends, and we had a lot of fun this quarter. For the next batch of 110 students, our advice would be this: make sure to adapt to fit the situation! We used a combination of soloing, pair programming, and mobbing to achieve our deadlines. It was effective because soloing and pair programming is good for splitting up work in general, but when something is due soon or there is a bug that is eating up a lot of time, mobbing works well to resolve the issue quickly. If you keep an open mindset and use a variety of tools, you will be able to adapt to any challenges that arise. [Obligatory “and have fun” sentence]
